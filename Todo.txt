TODO: Quest ideas go here:
    - Multi-stage followups -- go to *this* legendary then to *this* legendary then to *this* one
    - New goals: "become hated by X faction" or "become loved by Y faction" or "gain Z mutation"
    - Storyline-driven quests; create a quest generator that can generate a 1,2,3 step storyline
TODO: Add a quest option that is generated when you gain a certain number of fungal infections
