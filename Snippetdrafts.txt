Frozen by own fugue clone cold quest: <temporal fugue>
"*sniffles* Oh sorry I've... ah.. ah... ahCHOO! I picked up a cold the other day... *teeth chattering* It's these damn fugue clones, <name>. I don't know why I keep relying on my own alternate timeline-self. That <gender>'s a real moron, I tell you what. So the other day, I'm making my way over to <neighbor town> when I end up lost in the <biome> and am beset upon by a band of <biome creature>! So what do I do? I popped my alter-selves over from the space time continuum of course! But then I forgot I had freeze grenades in my bag. *tilts head back* ah... ah... AHCHOO! *blows nose loudly* I'm lucky I made it out alive. But now I have this cold, and it won't go away. Do you think you could find me something for my cold? <Apothecary> might be able to help.
