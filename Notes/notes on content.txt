i think that more dialogues i'd love to see are comments by NPCs on quests you have, maybe even on dynamic quests
m[but that wouldd require rewriting the engine a bit i think

Mituna:
imagine chatting with Irudad who has opinions on you helpipng out a village that reveres the Girsh


Agenda and Vendetta System:
Mituna:
maybe if you don't broker a peace, Argyve will get got by angry mechanimists later after he kills the zealot, and so on
m[ also dynamically generated moon kings as a subset of legendaries

mechanimist murder investigation party caravan you find in the northern salt pans then by the flower fields then by red rock or something

I did kinda want a Seven Samurai style quest where defend a village (originally kuyakya before it got updated) from a Templar warband

Mituna:
i think maybe Qud updating faction stuffs dynamically when a month passes ingame would be cool and won't be too frequent that it would be obnoxious


N2H4
something interesting would be grand scale alignments
like in this big region, all the villagers support the mechanimists or the barathrumites or the templar
and youll see people from those villages interacting with the faction they support, and you handle them based on those grander alignments


Sarcose:
someone might tell us to move this to modding because it's delving into the game's guts a bit much, but i was thinking just a part that the player keeps which simulates the various events being tracked in very very simple math, and then accesses the relevant spawning code when the player reaches certain coordinates
in this way, say, a caravan moving across several parasangs could be tracked in its movements, but only actually calculate anything once the player gets there



N2h4:
a funny reality folder bit would prob be them referring to you as water-sib then realizing that hasnt happened in this timeline
