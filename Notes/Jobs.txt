The amount of different jobs in the game is complicated and will lead to a growing complexity as this mod continues to develop. We will need 
to break it down.

Farmers have a specific role. Farmers are split up into Apple Farmers, Watervine Farmers, and Banana Ranchers. Tertiarily to this, farmer-themed
characters which are not in the Farmers' Guild would be Cat Herders, Pig Herders, Snail Herders, Amoeba Farmers, Crab Farmers, Goat Herders,
Leech Farmers, and Vintners.  

Merchants are based on specific merchant type. Tinkerers, Gutsmongers, Scribes, Chefs, Apothecaries, Jewellers are just a small number of them.

Dromads should get their own category. They will not be included in the first iterations of the mod as they are already a mysterious race to begin with.
Likewise, other nonhumans will not be considered *for the time being* as it will be enough just to get all this working. This may honestly be
the kind of thing to recruit the community's help for.

Then we have warriors - which includes Wardens and various guard-like characters. Caravan guards, Stilt guards, etc.. Those will have to be
hand-selected by ID to be given this type of job conversation.


Until a creature is given a job conversation it will not sue jobs in its conversation building.


We will start with three job categories:

Farmers
Merchants
Warriors

Categories will range from general to specific. Farmers will for instance have general farmer conversations, then specific "Farmer Class" info.

As such, we may have something that looks like this *FarmerConversation* under qc_elements.cs
