Uniques are named NPCs in the vanilla game *and* mods who either have a specific selection of conversation types or their own special 
conversation. One example would be Mehmet and Irudad, who may have What's Eating The Watervine? based context such as "we are doing the best
to recover the watervine" etc. etc..

This mechanic of the mod will *attempt* to single out and include unique characters added by other mods. Mods to consider:

Jademouth: Cat, Bright, Atacama
Exile's Refuge's "Warden" is not in Fellowship of Wardens, but *does* have a favored status by them.


In many cases, the definition of a Unique has simply to look for something like <nameofcharacter> and then add conversation types to it.
